## Qualities
### Natural Scent

You believe that you're so in touch with nature, your body odor is simply the scent of the wilds. 24 hours after a shower, you get a +2 to all social dice pools due to your confidence, but your "natural scent" imposes a -2 to your social limit. This is reset every time you shower.
*REQUIREMENT*: Completion of initiation ritual in a druidic tradition.

## Books
### Discord

Used for referencing a date (YYYYMMDD) that a post was made in our discord for the source. A copy of the source info should be somewhere in this readme too.
